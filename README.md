<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hey! 👋 This is a modern JavaScript/TypeScript client for the [OpenRouteService API](https://openrouteservice.org). I built this because I couldn't find a good client library for ORS and thought others might find it useful too.

## Why I made this

I was working on multiple projects that needed routing capabilities and while ORS has an amazing API, I couldn't find a good client library for it. So I decided to make one and share it with everyone who might need it.

What makes this client special:

-  **Zero runtime dependencies** - Seriously, check the package.json. All dependencies are just for building/development
-  **Works everywhere** - CommonJS, ES modules, TypeScript, plain JavaScript
-  **Full TypeScript support** - Complete type safety (no more `any` everywhere!)
-  **All ORS services** - Everything from routing to geocoding in one package
-  **Built-in throttling** - Automatic rate limiting compliance
-  **Actually useful error messages** - Know exactly what went wrong

## What's inside?

This client covers all the main ORS services:

-  **Directions** - Get routes with turn-by-turn navigation
-  **Matrix** - Calculate distances between multiple points
-  **Isochrones** - Find reachable areas from a location
-  **Geocoding** - Search for addresses and places
-  **POIs** - Find points of interest
-  **Optimization** - Solve vehicle routing problems
-  **Elevation** - Get elevation data for coordinates
-  **Export** - Extract routing graph data within bounding boxes

## Installation

```bash
npm install ors-client
# or if you're using pnpm like me
pnpm add ors-client
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Quick example

```typescript
import { OpenRouteService } from "openrouteservice-ts";

const ors = new OpenRouteService({
   apiKey: "your-api-key", // get one free at openrouteservice.org
});

// Get a route
const route = await ors.directions.calculateRoute("driving-car", {
   coordinates: [
      [8.681495, 49.41461],
      [8.686507, 49.41943],
   ],
});

console.log(`Distance: ${route.routes[0].summary.distance}m`);
```

## Getting an API key

You'll need an API key from OpenRouteService. It's free and you can get one here: https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/

The free tier is pretty generous for most projects.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## More examples

Check out the [examples](./examples) folder. I've added examples for pretty much everything:

-  Basic routing
-  Distance matrices
-  Finding POIs
-  Vehicle routing optimization
-  And more...

Each example file is runnable, just add your API key and you're good to go.

## For developers

If you want to contribute or just poke around:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/K4ryuu/ors-client.git
cd ors-client

# Install deps
pnpm install

# Run tests (you'll need a .env file with your API key)
cp .env.example .env
# add your key to .env
pnpm test

# Build it
pnpm run build
```

### A note about tests

All tests should pass with a valid API key. If some tests fail, it might be due to temporary API issues or rate limiting.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## TypeScript

Everything is fully typed. Your IDE will thank you. No more guessing what properties exist on the response object!

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Built-in Rate Limiting & Throttling

This wrapper automatically handles API rate limiting requirements to keep you compliant:

### Geocoding Services (Automatic)
- **Autocomplete, Search, Reverse geocoding** are automatically throttled to ~3.33 requests/second per endpoint
- Each endpoint has independent throttling (search + autocomplete can run simultaneously)
- This follows OpenRouteService's requirement that "requests must be throttled" for geocoding services

### Export Service (Manual)
- Export API has very strict rate limits - use sparingly
- Consider caching export results for reuse
- Export tests are skipped in CI due to rate limit sensitivity

### All Other Services
- No built-in throttling (directions, matrix, isochrones, etc.)
- Follow standard API rate limits based on your plan

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Dependencies

This package has **ZERO runtime dependencies**. None. Nada. Check the `package.json` if you don't believe me.

All the packages in `devDependencies` are only used for building, testing, and linting. When you install this in your project, it's just pure JavaScript/TypeScript code.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## API Coverage

All OpenRouteService endpoints are supported:

- ✅ **Directions** - Routing with turn-by-turn navigation (GET/POST, JSON/GeoJSON)
- ✅ **Matrix** - Distance/duration calculations between multiple points
- ✅ **Isochrones** - Reachability analysis (time/distance polygons)
- ✅ **Geocoding** - Address search, reverse geocoding, autocomplete (with throttling)
- ✅ **POIs** - Points of interest search with category filtering
- ✅ **Optimization** - Vehicle routing problem solving (TSP, VRP)
- ✅ **Elevation** - Point and line elevation data
- ✅ **Snap** - Coordinate snapping to road network
- ✅ **Export** - Routing graph data extraction (with rate limit handling)

## Error Handling

The wrapper provides detailed error information through `OpenRouteServiceError`:

```typescript
try {
  const route = await ors.directions.calculateRoute('driving-car', {
    coordinates: [[8.681495, 49.41461], [8.686507, 49.41943]]
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof OpenRouteServiceError) {
    console.log(`API Error: ${error.message}`);
    console.log(`Status: ${error.statusCode}`);

    // Quick error type checks
    if (error.isRateLimited()) {
      console.log('Rate limited! Try again later.');
      console.log(`Remaining requests: ${error.getRemainingRequests()}`);
    }

    if (error.isBadRequest()) {
      console.log('Invalid request parameters');
    }
  }
}
```

## Important notes

**Please consider supporting the OpenRouteService team!** If you can, definitely thank the OpenRouteService team for their work: https://openrouteservice.org/donations/

**Cache your API responses!** If you can, definitely cache your API responses to take some load off their servers and help everyone else by keeping the service running smoothly.
